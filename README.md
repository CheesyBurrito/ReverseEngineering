# Reverse Engineering Training Tools

The goal of this repo is to have an easy access to simple programs to see their implementatioin in ASM. I use IDA IDE as my tool to disassemble and analyze the code.

## Compilation

All projects include a makefile to compile them. I make sure that they are all cross-platform and will run on any standard OS (Windows, OSX, Ubuntu). In the folder that you want to compile, simply do ```make``` on OSX and Ubuntu and ```mingw32-make``` on Windows.
